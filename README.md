As I was originally gathering all SFOS changelogs to determine which packages appeared / vanished / were updated by which SFOS release, a excellent baseline for SFOS 1.1.0.39 is provided by [the SailfishOSS page on the MerProject Wiki](https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/SailfishOSS), which also lists the licenses of all packages (proprietary or a specific FLOSS licence), which are installed by default.

All SailishOS release version numbers and their release dates are listed at [**whitesoft/sailversion**](https://coderus.openrepos.net/whitesoft/sailversion) by [coderus](https://github.com/coderus).
